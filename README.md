№ 3D Shape Calculator

This Python program illustrates the principles of abstraction and polymorphism by using an abstract base class to model 3D shapes. It creates various shape objects — Sphere, Cylinder, and Cube — then calculates and displays their surface areas and volumes through a unified interface.

№№ How the Program Works
1. Random Shape Generation
The program creates a list of 10 randomly selected 3D shape objects — either a Sphere, Cylinder, or Cube. Each shape is initialized with randomly generated dimensions within the following ranges:

Radius: 1 to 10

Height: 5 to 20

Side length: 1 to 10

2. Calculations Using Abstraction
For each shape, the program uses polymorphism to call the appropriate surface_area() and volume() methods defined in the abstract base class and implemented in each subclass.
